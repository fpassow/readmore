  <h1>Don&apos;t Hide the Showmore Link</h1>

  <p>This text is always displayed. However, you cannot get to the rest of the content because the readmore link is hidden in a readmore element.
  </p>

  <p class="readmore">
  	<a href="#" class="readmore">... read more</a>
    This paragraph is only shown after the user clicks the &quot;read more&quot; link.
    And you can't do that, because it is hidden.
  </p>

  <a href="#" class="readless">read less</a>
